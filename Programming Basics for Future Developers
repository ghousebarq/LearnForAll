🧾 What is Programming?
Programming means telling a computer what to do using instructions called code. Programming means giving a computer a list of steps to follow — like a recipe!
If you can follow a recipe, you can understand programming.

💬 Programming vs. Coding
Programming = Thinking of what you want the computer to do.
Coding = Writing those ideas in a language the computer understands.

Why is Programming Important?
Programming helps run the apps, websites, and devices we use every day — like ordering food, watching movies, or using a GPS.

🧾 How Computers Understand
Computers are very literal. They only do exactly what you tell them.
Even a small mistake (like a missing semicolon ;) can break the code!

Where Can You See Programming?
Anywhere there's technology — phones, cars, smartwatches, even traffic lights — programming is working behind the scenes.

🌍 Programming is for Everyone

In the past, only a few people knew how to code. But now, millions of people are learning it!

You don’t have to be a software engineer. Anyone — like marketers, researchers, or students — can use programming to:

Make apps and websites
Analyze data
Improve their work
Understand the tech around them
Solve problems in any field/job
Be part of the digital world
Learning to code helps you understand the world and make smart choices in your daily life.


🤝 Programming Is Teamwork
You and the computer work together.

You bring creativity and ideas.
The computer brings speed and accuracy.
